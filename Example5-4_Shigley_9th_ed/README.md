# Some comments before running the code.

This example is taken from Diseño en Ingeniería Mecánica de Shigley 9a EdiciónURL

I attached the solution of the book as a pdf file, so that you could understand the aim of this program. I am afraid the example is in spanish. Besides, I added the Table A8 from the book so that you could see the data.

The aim of this program is to iterate over the values in the table so that the design factor is at least 4.

After running the code you will get a csv with the obtained results that prove the solution of the book.

This code was tested with Python 3.6. If you are trying to run the code with a previous version probably you will have to make some arrangments with the code because I used f strings inside the print() functions and I am not sure if \N{SUPERSCRIPT NUMBER} syntax is accepted there, I used it so that the output was more readable in the command prompt.
